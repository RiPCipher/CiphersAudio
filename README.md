Current Features:
- FFTProcessor Class (Useful for Visualization, although some work needs done to sync with realtime audio as it is not hooked into the Audio Stream(s))
- FFTBuffer Class

# Going Forward
Goals:

DSP - 
- Implement Multiple Oscillator types (Sine, Saw, Square, Noise)
- Implement Envelopes (and ADSR)
- LFOs
- Additional Effects (Improved EQ's, New Filters, Additional Distortion effects, other small things)
- Voice Management / Polyphony

UI -
- GDScript based controls (Knobs, Meters, Etc)

'Maybe' Goals:
- Improved Reverb effect(s)
- Improved Delay effect(s)
- Improved Mixer

'Its a nice thought' Goals: (Ranked by percieved viability)
- Wavetable Oscillator
- 'Unison'-like Detune Effect(s)
- Proper Vocoding
- Proper Convolution Reverb
- Anything that Serum does well
- Anything Ableton does well
